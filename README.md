#Diabetes Prediction Project
Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics.

#Project Overview
The aim of this project is to create a predictive model that can help identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes. By analyzing a dataset containing key health indicators such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and insulin levels, we can build a model that offers valuable insights for early intervention.
